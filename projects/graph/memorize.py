# create an empty queue and enqueue A PATH TO the starting vertex ID
# create a Set to store visited vertices
# while the queue is not empty...
    # dequeue the first PATH 
    # grab the last vertex from the PATH 
    # if that vertex has not been visited...
        # check if it's the target 
            # if so, return path 
        # mark it as visited... 
        # then add a path to its neighbors to the back of the queue 
            # copy the path 
            # append the neighbor to the back
